This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

**Disclaimer**

I use Python because I find it easiest for this type of coding. I treat solving
these as a write-only exercise. I do it for the problem-solving bit, so I don't
comment the code & once I find the solution I consider it done - I donâ€™t revisit
and try to optimize even though sometimes I strongly feel like there is a better
solution.

I don't even share code between part 1 and part 2 - once part 1 is solved, I
copy/paste the solution and change it to solve part 2, so each can be run
independently. I also rarely use libraries, and when I do it's some standard
ones like `re`, `itertools`, or `math`. The code has no comments and is
littered with magic numbers and strange variable names. This is not how I
usually code, rather my decadent holiday indulgence.
